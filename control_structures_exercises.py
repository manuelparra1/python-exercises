    print(i)

#         2a-IV. Create a while loop that will count by 2's starting 
#             with 0 and ending at 100. Follow each number with a new line.

#  2b. For Loops

#             entered is a valid number, also note that the input 
#             function returns a string, so you'll need to convert

#  3. FizzBuzz
#     One of the most common interview questions 
#     for entry-level programmers is the FizzBuzz test. Developed by Imran Ghory, 
#     the test is designed to test basic looping and conditional logic skills.
#     Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
#     For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number
#     For the multiples of five print "Buzz".
#     For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
